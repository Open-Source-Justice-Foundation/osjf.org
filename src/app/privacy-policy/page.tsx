          <p>
            No, as a general rule, we do not sell or rent your personally
            identifiable information to any one. If and whenever we intend to
            share your personally identifiable information with a third party

            notified at the time of data collection or transfer, and you will

          <p>
            We may disclose your personally identifiable information without
            your prior permission in special cases. For example, we may have
            reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to
            identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
            violating the User Terms and Conditions, or may be causing
            intentional or unintentional injury or interference to the rights or
            property of Company or any third party, including other customers.
            Also, we may disclose or access your personally identifiable
            information when we believe in good faith that Applicable Law
            requires disclosure.

            parties without your consent.

            does not identify a particular individual.

          <p>
            We may disclose your information if we are required to do so by law
            (including to law enforcement in the U.S. and other jurisdictions).

            WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose
            personal information on-line, your information can be collected and
            used by others. If you transmit or post personal information on-line
            that is accessible to others, you will not be able to control how
            that information is used by others. When we receive the transmitted
            information, we will use the procedures summarized in this Privacy
            Policy to ensure the integrity and security of that information in
            our systems. Unfortunately, notwithstanding any of the steps taken
            by us, it is not possible to guarantee the security and integrity of
            data transmitted over the Internet. Consequently, while we take the
            above-described reasonable steps to protect your personal
            information, we cannot and do not warrant the security or integrity
            of any information you transmit to us when registering for our
            Website or otherwise. All such transmission of information is at
            your own risk. Moreover, though we are committed to having our
            Website comply with this Privacy Policy, you are ultimately
            responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and your
            personally identifiable information. If you are careless with your
            password, or you decide to share your password with third parties,
            you must be aware of the risk that such third parties will have
            access to all your personally identifiable information.
